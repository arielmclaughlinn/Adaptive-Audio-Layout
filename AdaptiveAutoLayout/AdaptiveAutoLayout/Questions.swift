// We use Auto Layout so that the application that the viewer is on will display the same no matter what device they're on.
// A constraint is just what it sounds like. Whether it be a label, image, text view, etc - when we constrain them they will remain on that part of the screen when the apllication is launched.
// Yeah they are. They help us manage how we want everything to be displayed.
// Stackviews should be used when we want to have columns/rows. Stackviews manage the layout of it's subviews and makes it so we don't need to constrain as much.
